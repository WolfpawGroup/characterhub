# A relationship consists of the name of the relationship 
# and a whole number that is not lower than 0. 
# It would be advisable to edit this file through the CharacterHub tool
# but it is possible to edit it manually, just be careful to keep the format intact.
#
# Lines starting with # and lines with invalid format will not be processed as a relationship.
# Lines should not contain spaces and the name and value should be separated by a colon.
# Lines are separated by a windows newline. (\r\n)
#
# !Only edit this file manually when the CharacterHub is not running!
#
# Important: 
# Keep your relationship numbers constant!
# e.g: If Family is 0, Friend is 1 and Pet is 2
# if you edit this file and remove Friend, 
# don't set pet to 1, if you don't want 
# your friends to turn into your pets!
